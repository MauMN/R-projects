# Reaction times in a sleep deprivation study

<b>Description</b>
The average reaction time per day (in milliseconds) for subjects in a sleep deprivation study.

Days 0-1 were adaptation and training (T1/T2), day 2 was baseline (B); sleep deprivation started after day 2.

<b>Format</b>
A data frame with 180 observations on the following 3 variables.

<b>Reaction</b>
Average reaction time (ms)

<b>Days</b>
Number of days of sleep deprivation

<b>Subject</b>
Subject number on which the observation was made.

<b>Details</b>
These data are from the study described in Belenky et al. (2003), for the most sleep-deprived group (3 hours time-in-bed) and for the first 10 days of the study, up to the recovery period. The original study analyzed speed (1/(reaction time)) and treated day as a categorical rather than a continuous predictor.
